            The IBM 704 'Vacuum' was a landmark achievement in the development of digital computing. Introduced in 1954,
            this machine was the first to employ magnetic core memory, which allowed it to store and manipulate large
            amounts of data with greater speed and reliability than previous computers. It was also the first computer
            to use floating-point arithmetic, which made it well-suited for scientific and engineering applications.
            <br><br>
            Although it was slow by today's standards and required a human operator, the IBM 704 Vacuum set the stage
            for the development of smaller, faster, and more powerful computers. Its technological innovations and
            engineering breakthroughs laid the foundation for a new era of computing, and it helped pave the way for the
            digital revolution that transformed industries and societies worldwide.
            <br><br>
            Beyond its technical achievements, the IBM 704 Vacuum was also notable for its role in shaping the future of
            computing education and research. It was widely used in universities and research centers, where it helped
            train the next generation of computer scientists and engineers. Its influence extended far beyond its time,
            and it remains a landmark achievement in the history of computing.

    <div class="midinfo2">
        <h1 id="midinfoh2" class="midinfoh2">
            Well, theres a lot to know about it. Lets start with "Why it was created."
        </h1>
    </div>

    <div class="reasonsbullets">
        <div id="bullet1">
            • The IBM 704 vacuum was created because vacuum tubes were essential components in early computers like the
            IBM 704, allowing for fast data processing speeds.
        </div>
        <div id="bullet2">
            • Using the vacuum tubes and employing them in a computational device was a goal for many companies.
        </div>
        <div id="bullet3">
            • The IBM 704 vacuum supported the emerging field of computing and fulfilled the demand for more powerful
            and
            reliable computer systems, paving the way for future advancements in computing technology.

            How exactly does it all work? And whats a 'Vacuum Tube?'

        Well, a vacuum tube (as pictured on the right) is an early electronic device that uses the flow of electric
        current through a vacuum to control and amplify electrical signals.
        <br><br>
        Vacuum tubes were used in early computers like the IBM 704 as basic building blocks for electronic circuits,
        allowing for signal amplification, switching, and other functions necessary for computing operations.
        <br><br>
        In simple terms, it acts like an on or off, allowing 1 or 0 to be used in a computational manner.
    </div>

    <div class="simplehow">
        To use the IBM 704, users would write their programs on punched cards and then load the cards into the computer.
        The computer would read the cards and execute the instructions one by one. This process is called 'Batch
        Processing.'
        <br><br>
        Yes, theres much more happening internally, but for the most part, this is how it ran and was interacted with.

        <b>What were 3 positive effects of the IBM 704?</b>
    </div>

    <div class="positives">
        <div id="bullet1">
            + Increased computational power: The IBM 704 was one of the first computers to have a clock speed of
            thousands of instructions per second, which made it much faster than earlier computers.
        </div>
        <div id="bullet2">
            + Advancements in scientific research: The increased computational power of the IBM 704 allowed for
            significant advancements in scientific research, particularly in fields such as nuclear physics, astronomy,
            and meteorology.
        </div>
        <div id="bullet3">

        <br><b>Theres gotta be negatives, right? List 3!</b>
    </div>

    <div class="negatives">
        <div id="bullet1">
            - High cost: The IBM 704 was a large and expensive machine, with a price tag of around $3 million in 1954
            (equivalent to around $30 million today).
        </div>
        <div id="bullet2">
            - Limited accessibility: The use of punched cards for input and output meant that access to the IBM 704 was
            limited to those who had access to the necessary equipment and expertise to use it.
        </div>
        <div id="bullet3">
            - Environmental impact: The IBM 704, like many early computers, used vacuum tubes and consumed a large
            amount of energy. This resulted in a significant environmental impact, including the generation of heat and
            the consumption of large amounts of electricity.

    <h1 style="font-size: 60px; width: 100%; text-align: center;">Lets summarize it all.</h1>

    <div class="centered">
        <p style="font-size: 20px; width: 950px;">
            The IBM 704 was a mainframe computer introduced by IBM in 1954. It was the first mass-produced computer with
            floating-point arithmetic hardware. It used vacuum tube technology and had a memory capacity of up to 32,768
            words. It was used for scientific and engineering computations, and played a key role in early computer
            simulations, including the simulation of the first hydrogen bomb.
            <br>
            The IBM 704 was also notable for being one of the first computers to have a FORTRAN compiler, which made it
            easier to program complex scientific computations. It was eventually replaced by newer mainframe computers
            in the 1960s, but it played an important role in the development of computer technology and the growth of
            the computer industry.
